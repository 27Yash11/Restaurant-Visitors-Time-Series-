Restaurant Visitors Forecasting using Time Series Analysis:

The aim of this project is to forecast the number of visitors for a restaurant using time series analysis. The project utilizes a dataset containing historical data of the number of visitors in a restaurant over a period of time.

The project will start by exploring and visualizing the dataset to understand the trends and patterns in the data. Time series analysis techniques such as seasonality, trend, and cyclicality will be investigated to identify any underlying patterns in the data.

After analyzing the data, the project will develop various time series forecasting models including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA). These models will be compared and evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and root mean squared error to identify the most accurate forecasting model.

The final product of this project will be a reliable and accurate forecasting model that can be used by restaurant managers and owners to predict future visitors to their restaurant. This model can be used to make informed decisions such as scheduling staff and supplies, optimizing seating arrangements, and estimating revenue.

Overall, the success of this project will be determined by the ability of the forecasting models to accurately predict future visitor counts and provide actionable insights to restaurant managers and owners. By doing so, this project will help the restaurant industry make more informed decisions and improve their business operations.
